Funky Fresh Framework

TODO:
- Add an Event track to the sequence for loading assets etc. - STARTED
    - Replace events with tasks. - DONE
    - Add asset loading from SWRAM. - DONE
- Add a FX display track and a second simple effect (probably display Main/Shadow). - DONE
    - Add FX display from SWRAM?
- Much tidying up and code rearrangement needed. - DONE
    - Assets.
    - Display FX.
    - Separate out FX.
    - Rocket.

- Add another RVI effect that can be switched between.
- Figure out the run-time, no editor, track data interpolation.
- Move screen to 224 lines => 32 more scanlines.
    - R6=28, R7=33.
- Create separate loader.

Ponder.
- Loading full 20K screens during RVI takes a loooooong time.
    - Takes 104 tracker rows = 416 vsyncs = 8.32s
    - Perhaps just need to temper the pace of the demo?
- Scrubbing plus task loading ends up with the start of the demo not being realistic from a load-time POV.
    - Once MAIN & SHADOW RAM are initialised, you can't uninitialise them.
    - Perhaps if the task on the first line were a (debug) screen wipe?

BUGS:
> DEBUG (UNUSUAL): Indirect access to register $FCC3 at $153D - FIXED
> Doom screen doesn't get loaded if Rocket starts at or after that row? - DUPE
